Honeypot Token Guide: Illegal Use Cases
This guide explores illegal methods of utilizing honeypot tokens on the Ethereum blockchain or other compatible blockchain networks. A honeypot token is an ERC-20 token designed to restrict selling capabilities for buyers, except for the token creator or whitelisted addresses, enabling various exploitative strategies. This document, intended for blockchain developers, crypto enthusiasts, and those studying decentralized finance (DeFi), outlines how such tokens can be used in illicit schemes. It assumes you have set up your development environment (MetaMask, Remix IDE, testnet ETH) as described in prior steps.
Step 2: Illegal Applications of Honeypot Tokens
Honeypot tokens, built using Solidity smart contracts, can be programmed to manipulate cryptocurrency markets or deceive users. Below are common illegal use cases, leveraging the restrictive mechanisms of honeypot ERC-20 tokens to exploit unsuspecting participants in blockchain ecosystems.
1. Trapping Buyers for Profit
A primary illegal use of honeypot tokens involves creating a smart contract that allows buyers to purchase tokens but prevents them from selling, except for the token creator or designated addresses. This is achieved by coding restrictions in the transfer function of the ERC-20 smart contract.

Mechanism: The Solidity code includes logic to block transfers from non-whitelisted addresses, ensuring only the creator can sell tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. Buyers are lured through aggressive marketing or fake token listings, believing the token has high potential.
Execution: The creator pumps the token price by adding liquidity to a DEX pool, attracting buyers. Once sufficient funds are collected, the creator sells their tokens, draining the pool, while buyers remain unable to sell due to smart contract restrictions.
Outcome: Buyers lose their investment, as their tokens are locked, and the creator profits from the liquidity pool. Search terms: honeypot token scam, ERC-20 manipulation, DEX liquidity scam.

2. Fake Airdrops and Phishing Schemes
Honeypot tokens can be distributed through fake crypto airdrops to trick users into connecting their cryptocurrency wallets or revealing sensitive information.

Mechanism: The creator announces a free token airdrop on platforms like X, Discord, or Telegram, requiring users to connect their MetaMask wallet to a malicious DApp or website. The smart contract may require users to pay gas fees or send small amounts of ETH to "claim" tokens, which are actually worthless or unsellable.
Execution: The honeypot token’s Solidity code ensures the tokens are non-transferable for recipients, while the creator collects gas fees or uses phishing to steal private keys or seed phrases. Alternatively, the DApp may exploit wallet permissions to drain other assets.
Outcome: Users lose ETH or other cryptocurrencies, and their wallet security is compromised. Search terms: crypto airdrop scam, phishing DApp, wallet security breach.

3. Pump-and-Dump Schemes
Honeypot tokens can facilitate pump-and-dump schemes, where the creator artificially inflates the token price before selling off their holdings.

Mechanism: The smart contract allows the creator to bypass transfer restrictions, enabling them to sell tokens freely. The creator promotes the token through crypto influencers, fake news, or social media hype on platforms like X, driving demand and price.
Execution: As buyers purchase tokens, the price rises due to increased liquidity pool activity. The creator then sells their tokens at the peak, causing the price to collapse. The honeypot mechanism ensures buyers cannot sell, trapping their funds.
Outcome: The creator profits significantly, while buyers are left with worthless tokens. Search terms: pump-and-dump crypto, honeypot token manipulation, blockchain market scam.

4. Exploiting Non-Standard Seed Phrases
Honeypot tokens can be paired with fake wallets that use non-standard or invalid seed phrases (e.g., not compliant with BIP-39) to deceive users.

Mechanism: The creator distributes a malicious wallet application or website that generates fake mnemonic phrases (e.g., arbitrary words like "QWERTY" or phrases with 26 or 29 words). These phrases are linked to smart contracts controlled by the creator, allowing them to access funds sent to associated addresses.
Execution: Users are tricked into using the fake wallet, believing it’s secure. Any funds sent to the wallet’s addresses (e.g., for BTC, ETH, or ATOM) are accessible to the creator via the smart contract or backdoor private keys.
Outcome: Users lose all funds sent to the wallet, as the creator has full control. Search terms: fake crypto wallet, non-BIP-39 seed phrase, blockchain wallet scam.

5. Baiting Bots and Front-Runners
Honeypot tokens can target trading bots or front-running algorithms commonly used on DEXs, exploiting their automated trading behavior.

Mechanism: The Solidity smart contract includes hidden logic that triggers high gas fees or reverts transactions for non-whitelisted addresses attempting rapid trades. Bots detect the token as a new listing and attempt to buy, unaware of the restrictions.
Execution: The creator lists the token on a DEX, attracting bots that monitor blockchain mempools for new tokens. The bots incur high gas fees or lose funds due to failed transactions, while the creator collects fees or profits from initial liquidity.
Outcome: Bots and front-runners lose funds, and the creator gains from trapped liquidity or fees. Search terms: DEX bot scam, front-running exploit, honeypot token strategy.
